# Movie Database App in Vue.js

ðŸ‘‰ Click HERE to check out the deployed version.

## About the app

This is a movie database app (frontend only) with some hardcoded data stored in the Vuex store. Users can edit an existing movie record and add a new one which immediately appears then on the homepage. It's my very first app created in Vue.js.

## Goals
My goal was to create a user-friendly app with responsive design in Vue.js, so I can learn a new framework, compare it with the one I worked in before (React) and get to know a state management library Vuex.

## Technologies

* Node.js
* Vue.js
* Vuex
* Vanilla CSS (including CSS Flexbox)
