# Movie Database App in Vue.js

:bangbang: Deployed version [HERE](https://hopeful-lalande-c18237.netlify.app/)! :bangbang:

## About the app

This is a movie database app (frontend only) with some hardcoded data stored in the Vuex store. Users can edit an existing movie record and add a new one which immediately appears on the homepage. It's my very first app created in Vue.js.

## Goals
